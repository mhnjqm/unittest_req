5. The Spirit Director reviews and validates each generated TCU Honorarium Request Form.
6. The System delivers the generated report according to the specified report disposition and format as defined in the “Report generating parameters.”
7. The Spirit Director enters Social Security Numbers (SSNs) for each SuperFrog Student.
8. The Spirit Director enters the necessary Authorized Codes, including Account, Fund, Dept, and Project.
9. The Spirit Director confirms the printing of the payment requests.
10. The System prints all the completed payment requests.

**Postconditions:**  
- All TCU Honorarium Request Forms are generated, validated, and printed as specified by the Spirit Director.

**Extensions:**  
- If there are errors in the data or processes, the system should provide appropriate error messages and allow corrections.

This use case describes the process through which the Spirit Director generates and validates honorarium request forms, ensuring all necessary information is captured and printed accurately.

## Requisitos funcionais ##
Based on Use Case 18: The Spirit Director Generates TCU Honorarium (Payment for Services) Request Forms, the following functional requirements can be derived:

1. **FR-1: Initiate Honorarium Request Form Generation**  
   - The System must allow the Spirit Director to initiate the generation of TCU Honorarium Request Forms through a user interface.
   - This includes selecting relevant parameters that pertain to the services for which payments are requested.

2. **FR-2: Generate Reports Based on Input Criteria**  
   - The System must implement a report generation algorithm that creates TCU Honorarium Request Forms using data entered by the Spirit Director.
   - This should include data about the services provided and any other variables necessary for the report.

3. **FR-3: Display Generated Request Forms**  
   - The System must display the generated TCU Honorarium Request Forms to the Spirit Director for review after the generation process is complete.
   - The forms should be clearly formatted and easy to read.

4. **FR-4: Review and Validate Request Forms**  
   - The System must allow the Spirit Director to validate the content of the generated TCU Honorarium Request Forms, ensuring all details are accurate.
   - The ability to edit or cancel generated forms should also be available if issues are identified during the review.

5. **FR-5: Enter Social Security Numbers (SSNs)**  
   - The System must provide input fields for the Spirit Director to enter the Social Security Numbers (SSNs) of the SuperFrog Students associated with the honorarium.

6. **FR-6: Enter Authorized Codes**  
   - The System must require the Spirit Director to input Authorized Codes, including account, fund, department, and project, related to the honorarium requests.

7. **FR-7: Print Payment Requests**  
   - The System must provide a printing capability for all validated TCU Honorarium Request Forms.
   - Upon confirmation, the System must print the completed payment requests accurately.

8. **FR-8: Error Handling**  
   - The System must implement a mechanism to handle errors during data entry and form generation.
   - It should display appropriate error messages for any inconsistencies or issues to guide the Spirit Director to correct the data.

These functional requirements delineate the precise behaviors and functionalities that the system must exhibit to allow the Spirit Director to successfully generate, review, and print TCU Honorarium Request Forms.
